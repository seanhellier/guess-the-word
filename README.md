# word-guess-game2

In order to finish this assignment, I need to create a function that asks when the user's entered letters match the chosen word, and if not, increment the win counters and decrement the lose counter, and I have so far been unable to do so.

I'm going to continue to work on the project, because the inherent logic is key to understanding the process.
